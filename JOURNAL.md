# June 16th â€“ Project Kickoff ðŸŽ‰

Started planning and modeling for a large-format 3D printer project.  
Decided on a **Cartesian design with moving bed** (Prusa-style), not CoreXY, to simplify both firmware and hardware complexity.  

Generated first renders and started BOM listing.  
Created this GitHub repo to track and document progress.

**Total time spent:** 2h
