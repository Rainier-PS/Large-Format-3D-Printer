![render](images/printer_render.jpg)

Welcome to my custom production-quality 3D printer project, built for [Hack Club's Highway to Undercity](https://hackclub.com/highway/)!  
This printer is designed to offer a **large build volume**, **reliable performance**, and **modern features** such as **WiFi connectivity**, **auto bed leveling**, and **direct drive extrusion**.

## 🔧 Project Overview
- **Build Volume:** 310 x 310 x 340 mm
- **Core Features:** 
  - WiFi remote upload (via ESP32 connected to Mega)
  - Auto bed leveling (BLTouch)
  - Silent TMC2209 stepper drivers
  - Heated bed & all-metal hotend
- **Controller:** Arduino Mega 2560 + RAMPS 1.4
- **Firmware:** Marlin 2.1.2 (custom config)
- **Goal:** A DIY printer that competes with commercial-grade systems.
